sorry, Jax, I'm out. put those new fridges in under the bar, set up the kegs, taps are all flowing, head on the Broseph foaming up preeeeem. guess all you need is some fuckin customers, then we can talk. but seriously, as a friend - just sell the damn place. never gonna finish this town. they hazed you good with that low-rate mortgage, I know it. got a feel for that sorta thing. anyway you need somethin' hit me on the horn, i'm going back to pouring brew in NC.
