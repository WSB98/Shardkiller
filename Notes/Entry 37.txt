ENTRY 37
Jesus, those files... Maybe I should've just left them alone. Each of them could be a puppet without even realizing it! And those flights to the moon? What are they cooking up there? Was it human DNA or...? I couldn't run a thorough scan. I only had time to break through one folder's ICE.
Either way, I'm pretty sure they flagged me. Can't tell if it was an unmasking daemon or their dweller.
