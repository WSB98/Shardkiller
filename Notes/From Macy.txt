So this is how it's going to be? Fine. I'm done talking anyway. I've got nothing more to say... I'm just done. It's over. The lawyers will take care of the paperwork. And I'll go build myself a new life. You - go ahead, stay in this ghost town. Pay off that mortgage on a house that'll never be finished. Look at that signature of yours on that contract, the one that made us uproot our lives and then cost you your marriage. Maybe one day you'll get it through that thick skull of yours, they can back out whenever they want. And you'll be left with nothing. Take care,
Macy
PS No I'd rather you didn't come see the kids right now.
