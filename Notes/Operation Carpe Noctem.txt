FOR NIGHT CORP INTERNAL USE ONLY

The tests have come back successful. The artificial intelligence CN-07 has proven itself capable of bypassing commercial, device-specific and macro security systems accessible to NightCorp employees of the lowest ranks. None of the test subjects were aware that this experiment was being conducted on them.

In compliance with the orders it was given, CN-07 focused mostly on subject HK-13, which at the time of the experiment's commencement was classified as "calm and empathetic." After a period of subliminal conditioning, as we predicted, HK-13 began to display acute psychopathic behavior. The highlight was a dispute over coffee, during which HK-13 strangled one of their colleagues, then jumped out of the 16th floor window of the research facility.

We will soon commence the next phase of the procedure and install CN-07 onto the devices of our actual target.
