q000_nomad_lost_community_story
April 2 – start with a joke, avoid falling straight into the tone of an accuser and instigator, no fire and brimstone just yet: All Foods – All Saints?
first listen, then begin, ask questions aroound[sic]. What influence, according to the congregation, will the opening of this protein farm have on our community?
Ask about the absent – why didn't they come to service? guess – overtime, good money, maybe even double on a Sunday, as if in understanding
So be it, God will wait, God is patience, God is love. But the families? many folk take the double shifts, hardly seeing their kids and spouses. How long can this go on?
the community is fracturing, ties are breaking, resisting a corporation = a fight for the soul
end the sermon on a positive note: corps come and go, but community and church are forever. The safe bet is a bet on God!
