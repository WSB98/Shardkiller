ENTRY 36
Weird. It looks like anon_42 was right after all. I recently found a previously uncharted section of the Net out in the boonies, even though I'd already been there maybe twenty-odd times... I guess you can only access it with the right parameters.

It only cost me a week of sleepless nights, but I finally finished the Leviathan and punched through the section undetected... at least I think. Good thing, too, because it turns out anon_42 sicced NightCorp's servers against me. I really should just take a break, quit the Net for a few months... but those files did look really suspicious.
