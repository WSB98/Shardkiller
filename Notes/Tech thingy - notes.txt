TECH THINGY - NOTES
I forgot to change the notifications in the pressure gauge - add an automatic reset when starting it up

Tracking module froze underwater again - probably the waterproof case is blocking the signal. Fix - make an opening for an antenna.

Connection loss with the barometer when set at bathymetric mode. Fix - add an automatic signal to switch back to last position before connection loss
