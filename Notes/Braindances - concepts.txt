BRAINDANCES - CONCEPTS
BD of a woman giving birth:

Pro: nobody's done it yet
Con: have to hook up a prenatal Wreath, which is more expensive

BD of the most common dreams - compilation:

Pro: it's doable
Con: I'll have to consistently scroll the dreams of a dozen/couple dozen people over at least 1y to catch the repeating themes - flying, swimming, falling, going to work/school naked

2 BDs scrolled by two actors, neural tracks set up so that it looks like one BD:

Pro: it'd be nova
Con: tech for it doesn't exist
