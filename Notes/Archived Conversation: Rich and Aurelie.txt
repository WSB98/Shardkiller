generic_hacker_conversation
RICH: how'd you find me?
AURELIE: how do you think? I cut through your firewall like a hot knife through butter. outdated code-gates, prehistoric system architecture, your firmware's got more holes than a gangbang joytoy.
RICH: get to the point
AURELIE: i think netwatch found my BBS
RICH: what?
AURELI: BBS. a place where netrunners can exchange info without fear of being watched. like a hacker club. get it?
RICH: ok, but what do i have to do with it?
AURELI: your agency has access to one of them. if you could sniff them out, check if... i'll give you the coords.
RICH: no i can't...
AURELIE: please. if they find us, they won't bother with arresting and interrogating. do you understand?
RICH: i'm sorry. i already told you - we're through. if you want help, ask max. maybe apart from his supposedly huge dick, he's got some useful contacts
