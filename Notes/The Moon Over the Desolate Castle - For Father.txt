THE MOON OVER THE DESOLATE CASTLE - FOR FATHER
In spring, the castle held flowery feasts,
Cups of sake were passed around,
Moonlight shone through the great pine branches,
But where is that shimmering light now?

In autumn, the camp was covered in frost
Geese soared across the open sky,
Raised swords gleamed in the moon's soft glow,
But where is that shimmering light now?

The moon is perched high in the vast night,

The light shines as it always has, but on whom?
Nothing remains but ivy on the ramparts,
Nothing but wind rustles the great pine branches.

The seasons will forever come and go,
Prosperity will continue to ebb and flow,
The light shines as it always has,
Oh so high above in the vast night.
