q103_nash_shard
* girl is Aldecaldos, could be a problem * pitched camp nearby, job goes south - risk of retaliation. but fuck it.* Panam Palmer - new in town. Aldecaldos either starting biz in NC or something else is up. Girl asked around for a job at the Afterlife, they're doing recon. or Palmer's on her own * OK, job in bag, Palmer doesn't suspect a thing. Unsure about fixer, but if she's like the rest, couldn't give a flying fuck so long as the merch gets moved and the eddies find their way home.* wheels look worth at least as much as we owe the Hungarian. toss in a few extra packs and done
