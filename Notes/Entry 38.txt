ENTRY 38
They're watching me. And not just on the Net. Some shady-looking types followed me all the way to work today. When I finally worked up the nerve to turn around and face them, they vanished. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I think they were speaking Russian.
I'm starting to get a little freaked out.
