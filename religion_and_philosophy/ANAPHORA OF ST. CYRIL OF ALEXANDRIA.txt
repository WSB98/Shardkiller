ANAPHORA OF ST. CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA
We pray and beg for thy Mercy, Friend of Man, do not sentence us to Eternal Damnation, nor abandon those who are at your Service, nor banish us from your Sight, nor tell us you do not know our faces. Fill our Heads with Blessed Water, grant us a Well for our Tears so that we may weep for our Sins at thy Feet, for we are the humble Servants that graze in thy Pasture. Wipe away our Misdeeds and forgive us our Trespasses, whether committed willingly or unwillingly, consciously or unconsciously, in the Shadows or in Daylight, long forgotten or relinquished from our memory, for only thy Holy Name remains. Hear the pleas of thy People, look upon the suffering of thy servants, do not permit my Sins or the Impurities my own Heart lead thee to harden the Hearts of Others against the Holy Spirit.
