BUDDHISM AND CYBERWARE: A PERSPECTIVE
Interviewer: For most of us, the precepts of Buddhism seem baffling to say the least. How would you explain to the average Night Citizen why bhikkhu such as yourself are against implanting cybernetic technology into their bodies?

Monk: It's not that we're against them, per say. Every person has the right to make choices with their body so long as those choices don't harm another. Though bhikkhu do abide by stricter rules, such as abstaining from cyberware, in order to achieve Enlightenment.

Interviewer: Then what does your hesitation stem from? How do cybernetics affect your pursuit of Enlightenment?

Monk: Well...(short pause) Among other things, it's their vague, fluid status... for lack of a better word. Ask yourself - what is an implant? A part of your body? An impersonal object?

Interviewer: You're asking me? Uh... (unintelligible) ...suppose I'd say it depends.

Monk: Precisely. Bhikkhu limit their possessions to a robe, umbrella, and a bowl for alms. Everything else is a distraction that hinders his or her release from the world's suffering. Let's say, for example, that a synthetic hand is just that - a hand, a part of your body. But if it has a watch installed in it? A blade?

Interviewer: Right, I think I understand. Where the line's drawn isn't completely clear.

Monk: Possessions - especially such intimate ones - are distractions that muddy the mind, that pull it further from inner peace. I believe the phenomenon of cyberpsychosis is proof enough of this truth.
