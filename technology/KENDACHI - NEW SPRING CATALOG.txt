OUR PRODUCTS

Kendachi M-55 Powersword
For our blade buffs, our iconic Powersword is back and better that ever! Dice your foes into tiny pieces without breaking a sweat using our latest micro-serrated crystal blade technology. With highest-quality materials crafted into a lethal yet elegant design, the Powersword will look as good on your mantle as it does in your hand.

Kendachi Mono-Two CLASSIC
You can't improve upon perfection. This time-honored twin-blade has been in continuous production since 2019! Lit by a custom-color, handle-embedded laser, the Mono-Two has never gone out of style. Block every blow and slice through any defence. We wouldn't keep making them if people weren't buying them - order yours today!

Kendachi Monowire
A weapon as discreet as it is deadly. Made for those who desire power but have no urge to flaunt it, this molecule-thin blade is manufactured by our teams of expect engineers in our state-of-art orbital facility. The Monowire can bear loads of up to 3,000 lbs and slices through armorweaves like butter-flavored scopspread. Rumor is, many officials at the Zurich Convention wanted this weapon banned and off the market. Now if that's not high praise, we don't know what is!
