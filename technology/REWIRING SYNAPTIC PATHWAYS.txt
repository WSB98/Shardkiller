REWIRING SYNAPTIC PATHWAYS
Chapter 1: The Future of Neurotechnology

The twenty-first century heralded a worldwide revolution in neurotechnology. We, as a society, can no longer image[sic] an existence without technologically heightened senses, enhanced memory capacity, and pain modulators. By linking our neural systems with computer chips, we are capable of learning complex skill sets in seconds - then subsequently forgetting them again the instant they are removed. Today, after nearly eighty years of increasingly incorporating these technologies into our daily lives, we must now ask ourselves: What comes next?

In recent years, the academic community has reignited discussions on possible new methods to influence brain plasticity. Is it possible to create permanent neural pathways using coprocessors? Can we expect a breakthrough regarding dopaminergic data manipulation in our lifetimes? If so, what will be the consequences? The probable emergence of commercially viable artificial neurotransmitters would undoubtedly reshape the health science field, yet would simultaneously introduce a potentially destructive tool to most governments and corporations. The field of plasticity maniuplation[sic] remains in its infancy, but most experts agree we should prepare for a future in which such neurological rewiring will become as commonplace as the cybernetic implants used so pervasively today. Studies should begin exploring now how science can adapt our bodies to optimize the effects of this technology while minimizing its abuse and potential unwanted side effects.
