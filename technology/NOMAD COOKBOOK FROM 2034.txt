NOMAD COOKBOOK FROM 2034
Aunt Mary-Lou's juicy opossum roast

opossum (the fatter the better!)
3 parsnips
1 celery stalk
syn-bacon
olive pomace oil

Fry opossum and bacon together in oil until crisp, skimming any excess fat. Once browned, remove and set aside meat. Remove outer strings of celery, chop into small pieces and boil in a separate pot. When soft, remove and blend with grated parsnip in pan with remaining oil until you have celery-parsnip mousse. Add meat to a roasting dish, then cover with mousse and bake at medium-high heat for 20 minutes.
Remember that opossum pairs best with white turnip salad. Now you're prepared for the next big family dinner with this holiday crowd pleaser!

"Say it ain't snake!" soup

snake meat (2 types: water snake and rattlesnake)
chicken scraps
pork bones
fish head
(optional) various other scraps
lemon leaves
seasonal or synthetic veggies
corn starch
fresh ginger, sliced
dark soy sauce
various spices to taste

The most important thing to remember about snake soup is it shouldn't taste like snake. Step 1. Chop everything that needs chopping. Step 2. Chuck everything in a pot and boil for at least 6 hours. Step 3. Add more of anything as needed for taste. Step 4. Stir in corn starch to thicken.
