PUNCH CARDS: INSTRUCTIONS
Each position on the card (punched/unpunched) corresponds to a unit of information, while each column represents one character or symbol
When gently inserting the card into the reader, please remember to do the following:
- Check for any damaged punched holes, which may corrupt the reading
- Make sure cards are inserted in the proper order
- Double-check that the card description matches the data encoded on it
