SHEET METAL AND YOU: YOUR GUIDE TO AUTOBODY REPAIR
Just like you take care of your own body, so too should you care of your favorite four-wheeled friend. Many ask: when should I pull the trigger on making bodywork repairs? Simple answer: when it's no longer functioning at factory quality, typically as a result of collision damage, corrosion, damage from firearms, or general wear and tear.

But before you dive straight into the repairs, you should always first conduct a comprehensive survey of the damage. Not only the damage's nature but also the damaged part's core function in the vehicle as a whole should be thoroughly considered before choosing the best repair method.

Remember - always be sure to have the right set of tools handy before you begin with the repairs. And if there is any organic material still present in or on the vehicle (e.g. blood, bone fragments, etc.) always make sure to clean it thoroughly first. Do yourself a favor and don't make your job more difficult before you've even started.
