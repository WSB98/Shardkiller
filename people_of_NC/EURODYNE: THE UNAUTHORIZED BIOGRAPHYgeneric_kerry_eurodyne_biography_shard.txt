EURODYNE: THE UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHYgeneric_kerry_eurodyne_biography_shard
Unsurprisingly, Samurai never achieved major commercial success because the voice that directed the group's trajectory was that of demagogue-frontman Silverhand rather than that of Eurodyne, whose main aspiration was the pursuit of the music itself. Silverhand never possessed grand ambitions for creative expression; instead, he was hellbent on a personal path of devastation. These destructive tendencies had significant influence on Kerry and persisted long after the Arasaka Tower attack and Johnny's disappearance. Only following an extended hiatus did Eurodyne prove to the world his creative potential. He captured the imaginations and hearts of thousands of fans, securing him a spot in the company of music's legends.
