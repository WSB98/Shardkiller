STOP COMPLAINING - GET RICH TODAY! BY JOSH KAVORKIN
The first and most important lesson: you, and only you, are responsible for your situation in life. Don't wait for the government to take pity on you, don't wait for your loved ones to lend a helping hand - just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work! I know what you're going to say - unemployment is at 34%. But so what? What's stopping you from starting your own business? It's that damn simple! What's that? You say you need an education? So educate yourself, for chrissakes! From now on, I don't want to hear any excuses. What matters is that you can be rich too - but you have to WANT it! And for that, you have to WORK for it!
