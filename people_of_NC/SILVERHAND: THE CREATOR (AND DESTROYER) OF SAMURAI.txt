SILVERHAND: THE CREATOR (AND DESTROYER) OF SAMURAI
Hidden somewhere between the Arasaka propaganda and Silverhand's own self-curated image, there exists a real story behind the frontman of Samurai. The fact of the matter is no one truly cared to find it. Labels, legends, slogans to chant - that's all anyone every[sic] wanted from him. But by digging meticulously into all the dirty details of his life, all of the inconsistencies and exaggeration come to light.

One of the biggest gaps in Silverhand's life was the period he spent with nomad communities. Hidden from civilization, Johnny could have acted like himself and removed the mask he wears in public. If the world could get testimonies from the people who had contact with Johnny during this period, not only would every biographer be grateful, but - more importantly - experts might have a real chance to offer a clinical diagnosis for one of the rock scene's most iconic personalities.
