A GEM OF JAPANESE ELEGANCE
Hanako Arasaka's visit to Night City is a unique chance to take a closer look at a true icon of class and style. The enigmatic daughter of a recently deceased megacorp CEO has shown us once again why she's a real queen of killer taste.

First thing to note is that Hanako wore only Japanese designers, showing off a flair of the patriotism and devotion her she was raised with. Second, only a sharp eye might catch the small, golden brooch crafted in the shape of the Arasaka Corp. logo. Playing it safe but keeping it classy, Hanako also rocked a dove white, neomil pencil dress, simultaneosly showcasing a regal modesty but without putting off stiff prudishness.

Hanako is corporate royalty and she KNOWS it. She's not trying to squeeze in any of that neo-k flash, because her self-confidence is chrome-plated. That said, there are a few accents of gold in her dress, shoes and hair accessories that tastefully elevate the outfit and harmonize beautifully with her nails and Realskinn seams. Then, with her coat sporting a fierce red, she adds an almost predatory pop to the ensemble.

Color choice by coincidence? No way. Or a nod to the Japanese national colors? Probably way. As we've seen time and again before, Hanako doesn't shy away from incorporating both traditional and modern elements from her home country's heritage.
