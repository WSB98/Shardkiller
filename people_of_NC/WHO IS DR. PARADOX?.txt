WHO IS DR. PARADOX?
Who is Doc Paradox? Who's hiding behind the distorted mask?

Unsurprisingly, Doc Paradox won't say. After all, he's breaking the law - he has to protect his identity. If he revealed even the tiniest sliver about himself, NetWatch agents would be at his door in less than a minute.

But think about it. THINK. What kind of person could successfully hide from the world's most powerful corporations for years? Who could hack into encrypted T.V. channels? Who would disclose highly classified corporate secrets?

The answer's obvious. Doc Paradox is one of them. He's a puppet controlled by the establishment. To what end? Maybe this is how corporations funnel our anger and frustration in a safe and controlled manner, through a rebel who will never go so far as to issue a call to arms. Maybe he's being used to reveal "facts" that hurt the competition. Or maybe he's just a branding opportunity? In a month or two, Avante could put out a new, "Doc Paradox" line for us to wear our disapproval?

Only time will tell. But for christ's sake, don't listen to a word out of this phoney's mouth.
