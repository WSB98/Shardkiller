BLACK ON RED. THE ROAD TO NEOANARCOLLECTIVISMmq018_propaganda_shard
Leonard Swedenborg-Riviera

The inherent, immanent quality of late capitalism is the atavistic need to fuse capital and desire on the level of the superego, understood in the behavioral sense as well as the material sense determined by socioeconomic status. This is expressed through a deep aversion to the primal conflicts such as existence/nonexistence, life/death, good/evil and via the appropriation of extreme individualist values as per the Chicago school, which, as we know, is nothing but the cancer-begotten mongrel of classical utilitarianism. The self-aware neoanarcollectivist must abandon the evolutionist, darwinist temptation to pass on their genes at the cost of others, and to instead envision a society as a superorganism consisting of equal and coeval individuals subsumed in a collective, albeit unconscious Self. Its purpose will be to awaken this consciousness - to be both an Adam and Eve who, instead of fearing the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, chop it into fuel to kindle the Promethean fire of a New Consciousness.
