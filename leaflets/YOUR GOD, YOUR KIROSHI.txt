YOUR GOD, YOUR KIROSHI
The Catholic Church has never taken an official stance on implants, but the significant presence of all matter of bodily modifications among the clergy would seem to suggest (just like in other branches of Christianity) that implants are completely acceptable in the eyes of the Church.

The Mormon faith holds a different view - according to their tenets, no God-fearing Mormon can sport body-modifying implants, whether for aesthetic or functional purposes, the sole exception being life-supporting or other strictly health-related cyberware.

When it comes to the Islamic faith, imams regularly speak out against cyberware, though actual possession of bodily modifications is not officially barred.

Judaism does not have any provisions on implants, with the exception of Hassidic communities, where they are regulated individually by the community's tzaddik.
