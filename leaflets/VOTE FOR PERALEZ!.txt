VOTE FOR PERALEZ!
A no-holds-barred candidate with an entrepreneurial flair.

What am I fighting for?

An end to megacorporate influence on Night City politics. Naysayers be damned - we can do it! All I need is a token of your support to run a campaign without corporate funding. Together we can win these elections! If I win, YOU win!

What do you get in return?

A truly independent city. An end to megacorporate rule, an end to making decisions that affect this city and its people from behind the mahogany desks of board members that have never set on the streets of Watson or Pacifica!

Equal opportunities for everyone and access to education. During my first year in office, I pledge to create 20 full and 30 partial scholarships, with the eventual aim of funding the educations of the 200 most gifted students every year!
