DEATH OF A MERCENARY, AUTHOR UNKNOWN
Quick enough - not I
Nor bold enough nor agile
Tangled up in wires
Like a nest of vipers vile
Was it I who fell? Or was it done to me?
Dissolving, disappearing, with you I wished to be

Now tethered, clamoring, the restless swarm
Beating in my ears a pale rage - No!

Into the earth I seep, my life the sweet
Thorn sticks in my throat
A chill burns brighter - On
To the end? What a thought
A huddled husk I tumble for the dawn

-

The old certainty of youth is felled
And from its gnarled trunk
Memories fall forth
Hours of ours sharp and pressing race
Embittered in a powerlocked embrace

With you I wished to be and so I go!
Down a road without end through woods half-dreamt

And the chili-bleached delirium of desire
Flies into trepid trembling sand
Through the fog of your shadow sharpening
The storm tangles in me once again
To sway with you like sweet grasses dry
Still the glassy dust will naught but rise
