LAT-AM WARS
As a direct result of the armed conflicts on U.S. soil from the early 1990s until the early 2000s, Latin America (comprising South and Central America) remodeled itself into a strong federation of independent nations, bound through mutual aid and cooperation. The U.S.'s military presence was forced from Latin American territories with the exception of Panama, where it stood its ground despite fierce pressure from guerilla forces.

Many researchers and contemporary historians maintain that, in fact, the Lat-Am Wars were responsible for the U.S.'s eventual collapse, breaking up the Gang of Four (CIA, FBI, DEA and NSA) and decimating the U.S. Army. However, it's important to bear in mind that no external conflict could have toppled the colossus of American imperialism were it not already built on clay foundations.
