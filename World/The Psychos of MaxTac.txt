THE PSYCHOS OF MAXTAC
If a psychotic killer is prowling the streets, they're supposed to defend us. If your average Joe Blow goes ballistic in his cubicle, they're supposed to bag him and drop him off at the psych unit. They're supposed to make us feel safe in a world of madness. But be honest with yourself - have you ever really felt safe in the presence of MaxTac?

What the mainstream media won't tell you is that ninety percent of MaxTac interventions end in the killing of the cyberpsycho. And if you confront anyone about it, the official word is they "only take life when absolutely necessary." but don't buy into their bullshit! For them, the kill is a MUST. To keep bystanders happy with a display of bloodstained justice! And if a few civilians die? Tough. They'd say it's just a necessary evil for the greater good. Only... whose good, exactly?

I witnessed one of these interventions firsthand. The cyberpsycho stormed into a mall, armed to the teeth and shot seven people before slipping into a detached state of calm, mumbling God knows what to himself. MaxTac arrived after a few minutes and immediately opened fire. The gunfire jolted the psycho back into a frenzy. By the time MaxTac "secured" the area, twenty-five people had died. What a heroic success, huh?

You waiting for a bottomline? Here it is. ALL MaxTac members used to be CYBERPSYCHOS themselves. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. The same people who butchered innocents on the streets just a month, a week, a day earlier are now are now our knights in shining armor. Is it any surprise nearly each of their "interventions" ends in an "unavoidable" massacre? Just some funny coincidence?! You tell me!
