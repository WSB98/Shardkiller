MYSTICAL RAPTURE IN FILM
The supernatural as a subject has begun to disappear from film over recent years, yet another symptom of the world sliding from the spiritual realm into a profane cesspool of materialism laced with realism.
That is why "Brides of Satan," a film detailing the sexual escapades of medieval villagers in the pits of hell, deserves all the more attention. The seemingly hackneyed plot gives rise to deeper questions on the nature of good and evil, reminding us of mankind's ultimate helplessness against the power of Satan, who has one singular aim: to ravage the feeble, trembling human soul.

"Brides of Satan" is a must-see film for anyone interested in themes such as axiology and medieval European history.
