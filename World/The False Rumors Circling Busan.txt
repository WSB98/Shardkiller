THE FALSE RUMORS CIRCLING BUSAN
Conspiracy theorists have recently been roused by news of alleged human activity in the ghost city of Busan. Our younger readers may not recall that the Korean city - formerly four million strong - was wiped off the face of the Earth during the 4th Corp War. Unofficial sources out there point the finger at Militech, whose tendencies of tyranny led to the creation and spread of lab-drown, deadly virus. Accident, experiment, whatever the truth - the virus proved so--ahem--virulent that the United Korean gov still won't lift the strict quarantine on Busan all these decades later.

So why did all these tabloid-junkies and sensation-seekers all the sudden become so interested in the dead city again 50 years later? A Seoul-based detective unearthed satellite image showing signs of life. Well, technical "life" that is, in the form of active machinery. But no real surprise there. After all, Busan was one of the world's most heavly automated metropolises. It was a human virus, not the computer variety. Many of the robots go out their work, their repairs, their trash scooping and sorting. These mystery sat images? Just some computers that never got turned off. That's it.

The people of United Korea can sleep easy tonight knowing Busan is a ghost town in the metaphorical sense only.
