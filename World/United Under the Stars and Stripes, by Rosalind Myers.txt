UNITED UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES, BY ROSALIND MYERS
The twentieth century brought upon us great tragedy: nuclear war, catastrophic climate change, widespread hunger. Worst of all: the dissolution of the United States of America. Our great nation has often been forged and reforged in the polarizing fires of internal struggle. North against South. Democrat against Republican. Corporations against Federal Government. But we, as a people, knew how to temper this discontent and become stronger for it; even by force in our darkest hours. This has always been and continues to be our moral duty to the land we love and serve.

Humankind had never before known a nation like the United States. We were soldiers, the protectors of the free world. Our armies maintained order, our universities fueled innovation and progress, our industry spurred growth and prosperity, our press voiced the truths of our collective conscience. But when the United States tragically collapsed so, too, did civilization.

The time comes again, as it has so many times before, for America to rise up and set the world on a new trajectory of hope. However, we can only achieve our goals of a better tomorrow if we do not lose sight of who we are. We must now rally together beneath our star-spangled banner of these New United States. We must push aside those corporations and rogue states who denounce and would deny our pursuit of happiness. We must sacrifice them for our common good. I ask you to fight against those who would divide us. With debate. With pride. With blood and iron.
