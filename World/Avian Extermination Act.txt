AVIAN EXTERMINATION ACT
The AEA was adopted by the Night City Council on May 04, 2063.

Purpose: In the face of increasingly frequent and deadly zoonotic disease outbreaks, the City Council has decided that the most effective method for reducing the risk of infection among residents is via the extermination of all avian life within 18 miles of city limits (See Fig.1)

The extermination process will begin on May 07, 2063 once the call and selection of tenders for the contract have been completed (See Annex 2).
