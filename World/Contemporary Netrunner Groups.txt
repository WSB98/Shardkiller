CONTEMPORARY NETRUNNER GROUPS
Among all notable netrunner groups (or "cells") in recent years, Found in Translation has undoubtedly emerged as the most (in)famous. The four members of the group - known only by their aliases JD, AP, SK and BPM - primarily target major braindance studios and productions.

The first reported cyberattacks perpetrated by Found in Translation (FIT) were breaches of studio data fortresses that contained braindance files slated for release. They made slight adjustments to the recording data in order to replace positive emotions toward corporations with hot-blooded hate and to erase corporate logos that were planted for promotional purposes.

In July 2076, after a FIT-altered version of the braindance "Badlands Raid" hit the market in the Pacific Northwest, many consumers took to the streets of Seattle in a surge of violent anti-corporate riots. Following the incident, studios tightened security measures and law enforcement authorities formally recognized FIT as a terrorist cell that posed a significant risk to public safety and order. In response, FIT adapted its tactics; rather than solely launching attacks on braindance producers, they have begun to infiltrate domestic and commercial braindance units to corrupt or alter data. Their most recent data-manipulation attacks on the braindances "Wasteland Fury" and "Slave to the Supervisory Board" have cemented their repuation[sic] as a formidable netrunner cell that refuses to yield to outside pressure.
