PROTEIN FARMS: A REPORT
Protein farms are currently the source of most meat and meat-substitute products in Night City. Biotechnica is the clear industry leader, providing for over half of the city's demand for alternative protein. Currently, the most popular, albeit cost-intensive form of production is based on protein-rich crickets, which allow producers to achieve the highest-quality protein. Earthworms are available as a cheaper alternative, achieving a higher yield of product per square meter. However, worms pose a more difficult marketing challenge - while crickets have become acceptable, most consumers still bristle at being told to "go eat worms."
