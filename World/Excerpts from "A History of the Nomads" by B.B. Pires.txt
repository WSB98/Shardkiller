It's hard to imagine a group less inclined to wandering than farmers, but in fact they were the people who dawned the age of nomads. Natural catastophes, crops ravaged by bioplagues, armed conflicts and martial law allowing corporations to speculate and privatize land - all this forced them into a life on the road. The first clans recognized as "nomadic" were the Aldecaldos and the Jodes, followed shortly after by Snake Nation, Thelas Nation, Folk Nation, Blood Nation and MetaCorp - a total of Seven Nations.

The nomad nations are divided into tribes, which are subdivided even further into clans and families. A family typically numbers between ten and a hundred people, while the biggest nations can reach up to a million.

At first, nomad activity was seen as anarchistic and subversive - mostly, as you can imagine, by corporations who quickly realized they wouldn't be able to control them.

After all, families come together to build, not to destroy. (...)
