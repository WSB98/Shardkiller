THE WARSAW CATHOLIC FAITH AND ITS ORIGINS
As Saint Augustine of Hippo taught us, to err is to be human, but to err willingly is to perform work of Satan. Pope Ferdinand I and his successors are guilty of this heinous sin for their perversion of Christ's teachings and their worship of the golden calves of technology and Mammon. They have not only chosen this path to perdition for themselves but have attempted to tempt the Lord's flock to follow. For the sake of the millions of eternal souls he loves so dearly, Cardinal Konrad Lewandowski made the only decision God would allow. Seeing that the Vatican had renounced our Lord and Savior, he rescinded his nomination to head the Holy See and instead rested the weight of the newly founded Polish Papacy on his shoulders and moved the seat of the Church to Liche≈Ñ, Poland.
