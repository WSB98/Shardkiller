ALL FOODS â€“ THE FUTURE OF MEAT
Not only are All Foods products healthy and nutritious, they will feed our future.
Soon, All Foods will launch a pilot line of new products to complement the EEZYBEEF brand. This series of meat products will be based on flatworm cultures, which have been found to significantly help increase metabolism, slow weight gain, and cleanse the intestinal tract. We hope the flatworm initiative will usher in All Foods' latest successful generation of meat products.
