ARASAKA ACADEMY: BEST OF THE BEST, OR BEST FOR THE BEST?
mq049_02_arasaka_academy
Arasaka Academy emerged as the #1 ranked institute of secondary education in Night City for the fourth consecutive time according to the Night City Pespective's annual review. The periodical earns the lion's share of its advertising revenue from academy's namesake corporation, though their editorial staff claims this financial cooperation does not influence their rankings.

The magazine's education experts claim Arasaka Academy's infrastructure has no equal in Night City. Bias or otherwise, we cannot argue them on this point. Lessons are primarily conducted via virtual reality or AI-generated lesson plans suited to a student group's specific needs. Public schools, meanwhile, can only dream... It comes as no surprise, then, that parents who are not gainfully employed at a a megacorp are increasingly willing to incur a lifetime of debt for a chance to give their child a chance at the city's most prestigious education.

But there are many uncomfortable truths the Academy is struggling to keep silent.
Academy Administrators promote a culture of constructive competition among its pupils as a way to forge the world's next great corporate executives. A rat race by another name with a diploma at the finish line...

Night City Perspective factors replacement in corporate leadership roles into their calculations, and with this criterion I take no issue. What they don't include, however, is the drop-out rate. The enormous pressure these students face inevitably translate to anxiety, depression and, for some, even suicide. These rates are especially high for students outside the Arasaka corporate family. Such is the dark side of Arasaka Academy's glowing reputation.
