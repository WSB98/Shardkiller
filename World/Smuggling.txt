(...) If you want to transport goods, you need contacts. Without contacts, forget about doing business. Who will you need to pay off? Customs officers, guards, the people at the gas stations. Don't forget the motels. You take care of that, you can show up and vanish as you please. Keep them happy and they'll know when to turn a blind eye. It's also a good idea to strike a rapport with the fellows from Orbital Air - that is, if you're planning to ship something into orbit. Remember those boxes full of seedlings last year? That could only have happened because my boys at OA customs looked the other way for fifteen seconds.

Make sure you're well-equipped. Don't use standard signal jammers - customs agents aren't stupid - they'll know you're hiding something at the border, besides which there are no models they can't disable. Use upgraded jammers that work hyper-locally, in the exact place you're hiding the goods. Secure packages with ICE, ideally bought from us. You can trust family.

Use your imagination. Do you know how I managed to transport a few dozen pounds of drugs to SoCal? I paid the right people not to ask any questions and hitched a ride with an All Foods convoy. Nobody realized that several containers of food were packed full with drugs.

Plan your routes carefully. You have up-to-date border patrol routes and areas scanned in real-time by corporate satellites. And you have good ol' American roads. Use backroads and routes that corpo convoys would rather avoid. You can also dance around those old minefields since the corps don't patrol there anymore, although apparently by now they know we pass through there and it's only a matter of time. Use the tunnels as a last resort. These days it's usually a one-way trip - you go through one and the second you're out the satellites have a lock on you. So in case you do - step on it. And most of all, brothers and sisters - don't get caught.
