CHIBA 11
Every megacity has a center and a periphery, business districts and joyhouses - and no megacity is complete without one or two slums. These are neighbourhoods that even corpo suits are afraid to walk through, where the police don't respond to emergency calls, where the ambulances take the long way around, and where the rattle of gunfire never stops. In Night City it's Pacifica, in Berlin - Pankow, and in Tokyo - Chiba 11.

Those unlucky enough to be born in Chiba 11 usually end up facing two choices - join a gang and kill or be killed, or worm your way under a corp's protection. The suits in their glass towers look down on the lowlifes spawned in Chiba, but they're very well aware that if you save a person from abject poverty, they'll do anything for you without a moment's hesitation or guilty conscience. That's why Japanese zaibatsus open their doors to a select few from Chiba - the strongest, most determined, and above all, the most cunning. These supposedly fortunate souls are sent on the most lethal missions to the most dangerous corners of the world. Most die or disappear, but those who survive this trial by fire are welcomed back home as legends.
