INSIDE METACORP
We associate nomads with chaos, societal collapse, technological backwardness... And for good reason! But there are always exceptions to the rule, and for the nomads, that exception are the Meta - more specifically, MetaCorp.

Unlike other nomad groups that deal in smuggling and raiding, the Meta are strictly law-abiding. MetaCorp, formally registered in the Western Corporate states, is a majority stakeholder in numerous shipping companies, including the rapidly-growing DTR (Decker, Tanaka & Rogers), which handled 53% of all of America's transport last year.

The story of MetaCorp is a story of American entrepreneurial spirit and confidence in the future - two things that not even a nuclear war could destroy. Indeed, MetaCorp only proves that a new order can rise out of entropy, that the rustle of eurodollars is capable of civilizing even the most savage barbarians.

Last month I had an opportunity to visit the company's headquarters in MetaKey, the mobile island currently anchored in the Gulf of Mexico. There I met Victoria Meta, the corporation's nomad CEO and granddaughter of MetaCorp's founder, Jonathan Meta. Victoria had clearly inherited his steely gaze... and enterprising mind.
