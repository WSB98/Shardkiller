DR. HAVOC & RADON
Introduction

The Battery Sphere is in dire straits. The Irinians have occupied almost half the city. Them and their technorat scourge have transformed almost everyone in hordes of mindless zombies. Battery Arena is now the final point of resistance against the invaders from Planet X. It seems the end if inevitable. That is... until the legendary mercenary pair arrive just in the nick of time after years of mysterious absence! Amidst the cigar smoke and glint of chrome armor, Dr. Havoc and Radon slaughter scores of enemies without mercy. After all, who could possibly slow the mighty force of a laser-armed mountain of muscle and his spitfire of a sidekick who can transform into a sentient cloud of radioactive gas?

I'll tell you - no one so far. Rose Tenorio and Martoni Eleazar take us into the world of computer games first imagined in the bestseller novel "Kibble and Scop" by Abe Frost. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a roller coaster ride of comic-book violence! If you've ever wondered what the action of the BATTERY ARENA may have looked like, "Dr. Havoc & Radon" is a must-buy. Dive in now.
