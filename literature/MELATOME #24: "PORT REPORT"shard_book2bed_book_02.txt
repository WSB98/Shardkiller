“Port Report: Collector's Edition” (63 volumes)

For forty long years, Melinda Warren worked in the harbormastor's office, scrupulously recording literally everything she saw. A keen observer of her surroundings, Melinda's notes now fill over sixty (that's six-zero!) volumes, each note more tedious than the last. How does she do it??? Races, gunfights, dramatic turns of events – pssh, leave that for the losers who don't have to get up for work tomorrow! Read Melinda's notes to find out exactly how many tons of silk were unloaded in 2072, and more precisely, how many yards of cambric, jacquard, crepe, satin and chiffon! If that shit doesn't put you to sleep, see your ripperdoc, stat!
