"CHROME AND YOU" - EXCEPT FROM A NOVEL BY ANONYMOUS
We are temporary. Expendable. Replaceable. The sooner we come to realize that, the better. After all, our days on this blue speck of dirt are numbered, are they not? Very strictly numbered, in fact, thanks to this plethora of technology that surrounds us and permeates our bodies. But that's all fine and dandy, isn't it? Just know this: only a few decades ago people were still attached to their body as something that justified their existence and foregrounded their identity. Know this: less than a century ago, implantation was still considered to be invasive - an attack on our fundamental, physical connection to reality. And now? Your body is only a spare part, your existence is upgradeable, and your here-and-now is constantly getting outdated. So who ARE you? You're temporary. Expendable. Replaceable. Feel that, know that, and you'll regain your freedom.
