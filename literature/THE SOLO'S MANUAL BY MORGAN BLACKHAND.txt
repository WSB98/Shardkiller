THE SOLO'S MANUAL BY MORGAN BLACKHAND
INTRO

Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do. Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) - that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombatta out of, one who tells you every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll say if you're lucky.

Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.

So you still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?

Good. Then this book's for you.
