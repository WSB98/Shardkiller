DRAFT REPORT - DOCK DISTRIBUTIONma_wat_lch_06_onscreen_02
I drew up the accounts for this month and it looks like we made a handsome profit off our original investment. I talked to Frankie, the guard, who claims the glitter cut with paracetamol is by far the most popular choice. He also pointed out that attempted break-ins into the warehouse have increased seeing as how our newest blend is highly addictive. Thus he's demanding more guards and enhanced security measures. Needless to say, I nipped that idea in the bud immediately. I told him that we could always replace him with a Kang Tao robot if he can't adequately perform his duties, so I doubt we'll hear any more complaints out of him. That being said, we should consider the long term - maybe it's worth swapping him our for a robot?
In any case, I'm expecting continued profits in the short-term, though we still lack reliable long-term data, as we shall see how the product affects our customers' lifespans. Reports of an increase in cyberpsychosis cases directly correlates with our distribution network, but of course we'll omit that from the report. In a few months we might be in a position to model some accurate simulations. To that end, I gave Frank the task of gathering the necessary data within his territory.
