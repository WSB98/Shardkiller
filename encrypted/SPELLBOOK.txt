BBS rumor mills actually churned out some truth - that Zetatech fort is a fucking Alcatraz: modified PitBulls at each entry port, SpeedTraps and SeeYa at access points. Soon as i step foot in their net, they set Flatline on my ass. Nice try, Zeta but a little Aardvark and Killer-VI combo meal did away with that. But for real, it wasn't easy - my trusty Elysia was smokin like a flare gun by the end of it - but I got the job done. Don't believe me? Check it yourself. I left a little note at the top of Zeta's fortress where their logo used to be
SPIDER MURPHY WAS HERE XD

OH FUCK
HE ACTUALLY DID IT!!!
Bartmoss unleashed DataKrash - whole Net's falling apart before my very eyes. Data fusing together, fortresses melting like ice cream, 1's and 0's flooding the information highway. Global stock market's losing it's shit - Dow Jones dropped by hundreds in a single hour, Kang Tao's CEO committed suicide, NetWatch is running around like a headless chicken. HOLY FUCK! Say goodbye to the old order! Death to corps! WHOOOOP!!!!

Bartmoss was wrong. Everyone was wrong.
The net was a mirror held up to our thoughts and dreams - our lives. Bartmoss took it and shattered it into pieces, thinking that that would be enough. But as it happens, you can still see your reflection in every shattered piece of glass. Now instead of one mirror, we have thousands of them.
Every corp, government, gang now has their own Net that they rule with an iron fist with no regulation, no accountability. Surveillance hasn't disappeared. In the hands of those who govern us, it's only gotten worse. They're like modern-day Fates with optic cables of our lives wrapped around their chrome fingers, ready to be cut at a moment's notice. They hear our frustrations, they look upon our futile rebellion and they laugh - they laugh so hard the whole world trembles at its very core.
